This repository contains code accompanying a blog post on how to write a figma / miro style canvas in react and typescript.

This is part 1, where cards can be dragged around a canvas (but panning and zooming of the canvas are not available, and there is no way to add cards to the canvas).

You can run the code with `npm run dev`

You can view a live demo of the code at https://ceddlyburge.github.io/react-figma-miro-canvas-part-1/
